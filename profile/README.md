# **InitRepo**

### **The Context Layer for AI-Driven Software Development**

**InitRepo is an ecosystem designed to solve the core problem of "vibe coding" by creating a structured "source of truth" for software projects. This ensures that both human developers and AI coding agents work with clarity, precision, and perfect alignment.**

## **The Problem: A Lack of Shared Context**

Development teams, especially those using AI assistants, suffer from a lack of shared context. This leads to "vibe coding," where work is based on assumptions rather than clear specifications, resulting in scope drift, duplicated effort, and buggy code.

Our vision is to become the industry standard for managing and distributing software project context, enabling any developer or AI agent to instantly understand the *what*, *why*, and *how* of a codebase.

## **An Ecosystem for Project Context**

InitRepo is built on three pillars that work together to provide a seamless context management experience.

### **ü§ñ initrepo: The CLI (Open Source)**

The free, open-source entry point for developers. This is a focused, powerful utility designed to be a fast and reliable codebase extractor.

* **Core Purpose:** To prepare an existing project for analysis by scanning a local repository, respecting its .gitignore file, and packaging all relevant source code into a single, structured file.  
* **Primary Command:**  
  Bash  
  \# Scans the current directory and creates a context package  
  initrepo extract

### **üåê initrepo.com: The SaaS Platform**

The central web application and primary engine of the ecosystem. This platform acts as the "Blueprint Generator" for new projects and the planning hub for new features.

* **Initial Blueprint Generation:** Transforms a project idea into a comprehensive set of Agile-powered documents (PRDs, User Stories, Architecture Specs, etc.).  
* **"Feature Planner" Workflow:** Uses a project's existing context to generate a detailed implementation plan for a new feature, perfectly aligned with the current codebase.

### **üîå The MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

The underlying API and data schema that powers the ecosystem. The MCP is the standardized protocol for any AI agent to request and receive project context, enabling high-value B2B services.

* **B2B Offering 1: The "Blueprint Marketplace"** for AI IDEs to scaffold new projects.  
* **B2B Offering 2: The "Living Documentation" Service** to monitor dependencies and automate upgrades.

## **üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap**

We are building InitRepo in phases. Here is our strategic rollout plan:

* **Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)**  
  * **\[‚úì\] SaaS:** Build the core document generators (PRD, Architecture, etc.).  
  * **\[ \] CLI:** Build the initrepo extract command.  
  * **\[ \] Protocol:** Define the v1 JSON schema for the "Context Package".  
* **Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion**  
  * **\[ \] SaaS:** Launch the "Feature Planner" workflow.  
  * **\[ \] CLI:** Add the initrepo plan command.  
  * **\[ \] Services:** Launch the Pro Tier of the "Living Documentation" service.  
* **Phase 3: B2B Integration & Market Leadership**  
  * **\[ \] API:** Launch the "Blueprint Marketplace" B2B API.  
  * **\[ \] Community:** Build out initrepo.tech with comprehensive API documentation.  
  * **\[ \] Services:** Launch the Enterprise Tier of the "Living Documentation" service.
